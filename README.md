***
The project constructs a 3-layer BP network to do the Iris classification.

The first 100 samples will be used for train set, and the rest is for test set.

Since the total number of samples is small, there will be no validation set.

***
There are:

5 neurons in the input layer (4 attributes and 1 bias),

7 neurons in the hidden layer,
3 neurons in the input layer(3 species in total).
